####eighth blackbird: ensemble-in-residence

Described by The New Yorker as "friendly, unpretentious, idealistic and highly skilled", eighth blackbird promises its ever-increasing audiences provocative and engaging performances. It is widely lauded for its performing style: often playing from memory with virtuosic and theatrical flair and its efforts to make new music accessible to wide audiences. A New York Times reviewer raved, "eighth blackbird's performances are the picture of polish and precision, and they seem to be thoroughly engaged by music in a broad range of contemporary styles." The sextet has been the subject of profiles in the New York Times and on NPR's All Things Considered; it has also been featured on CBS's Sunday Morning, St. Paul Sunday, Weekend America and The Next Big Thing, among others. The ensemble is in residence at the University of Richmond. Visit eigthblackbird.com for more information on 3P's ensemble-in-residence. 

####Sam Kelder, viola

Violist Samuel Kelder is a multifaceted performer of contemporary music and proponent of interdisciplinary collaboration. Beginning his violin studies at the age of six in Houston, Texas, Sam grew up with an inquisitive mind for the arts and passionate dedication for sharing music with many communities. Described as “dynamic and committed” by the Boston Globe, Sam performs regularly in New England, namely with Callithumpian Consort, Sound Icon, Ensemble Mise En, Hub New Music, Times Arrow Ensemble, and various regional symphony orchestras. As violist of the Vellumsound, the newly appointed ensemble in residence at the Museum of Fine Art Boston, he co-presents interactive and educational projects that span the depth of music history from Purcell to living Boston-based composers. In addition to local projects, he has also performed as soloist at the Third Practice Electroacoustic Festival and NYCEMF. Sam holds an undergraduate degree from the University of Houston, a Masters Degree from Mannes the New School for Music, and is in pursuit of his doctoral studies at Boston University as teaching assistant to Michelle LaCourse.

In his spare time Sam enjoys teaching, cooking, reading, and exploring.
