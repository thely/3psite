* Mark Applebaum
* Benjamin Broening
* Kristine Burns
* Alessandro Cipriani
* John Gibson
* Colby Leider
* Mason Bates
* Matthew McCabe
* Larry Polansky
* Ricardo Climent
* Scanner
* Stephen Vitiello
* Mark Wingate

These artists were asked to consider the relationship between contemporary electroacoustic music and the musical past. To what degree does new technology suggests new modes of musical expression? To what extent do new techniques of music production and dissemination represent a break with received notions of musical composition and consumption? Or is it perhaps more accurate to think of electroacoustic music as a continuation of a shared musical heritage? 

That there is no simple answer to these questions reflects the richness and diversity of technical and aesthetic approaches to electroacoustic music. These brief pieces reflect, reinterpret, comment, recompose or reconsider past musical compositional techniques, practices, specific works, genres, styles, forms, practices, concerns in light of electroacoustic music. The works were premiered at the 2006 Festival and are available on the Everglade label.
