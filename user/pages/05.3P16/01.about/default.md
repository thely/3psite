Third Practice is an annual festival of new electroacoustic music and mixed media presented by the Department of Music and the Modlin Center for the Arts at the University of Richmond. Now in its fifteentn year, the festival will present works for instruments and computer, video, and stereo and multi-channel works for fixed media. The festival will feature eighth blackbird, our ensemble-in-residence, as well as featured guest artist Sam Kelder, viola. 

Third Practice 2016 explores the emerging electroacoustic art form and its relationship to past and present musical practices. This year the festival will present pieces that explore voice and text, the boundary between experimental and popular musical practices and a range of modes of improvisation with technology. 

The festival will take place November 4-5, 2016 in the Modlin Center for Arts on the campus of the University of Richmond. No tickets are required, and every event is free and open to the public.
